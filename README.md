# React app Creator

This project configuration includes:
- create react app with typescript
- eslint with airbnb rules
- prettier 
  It is s not part of eslint rules. Reason is that we dont want to see prettier errors  at the time we develop. 
- editor config
- husky with lintstaged
- jest and react testing library


# Next steps

Check if we can run prettier as part of eslint having rule  prettier off (.eslintrc.js) in order to not see errors during developerment and when using hook to enable that rule using --rule Object param on cli
